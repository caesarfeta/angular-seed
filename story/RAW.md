The inventor got into an argument with his wife.
She was sick of doing his dirty work.
So she left for the city.

The inventor was heartbroken.
He went for a long walk to get his head straight.
The inventor was sitting by the river when he had his big idea.
He hurried to his laboratory and started working.
For three days straight he clanged and banged bits of metal together,
  put glowing liquids into bubbling testtubes,
  and typed commands into a giant computer.
He enjoyed working.
It was a nice escape from unpleasant thoughts which had haunted him since childhood.
The typical stuff a young man endures.
Getting beat up by a bully.
Being rejected by girls.
Being bored in school.
Being bored at work working for another man.

The inventor wanted to live a life of constant daily wonder.
Uncovering the mysteries of the universe and all that jazz.
But who can live that life
