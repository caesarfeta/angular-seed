Hello. My name is Adam Tavares. I am a programmer, artist, and nature enthusiast. My primary interest is building elegant software to help examine data and generate mathematical art. When not working I explore forests, draw cartoons, and play capoeira. I currently live in beautiful Providence, Rhode Island.
