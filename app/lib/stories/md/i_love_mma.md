## Feeder styles -- Creating artificial limitations

Artificial limitations are valuable.
Learn a system.
Learn how to operate inside the system.
Learn how to play with the system alone and with a partner and in a group.
What are the edges of the system?
What is not understood by the system can defeat it.

What's the most "meta" human fighting system?
MMA is trying to find out.
We're slowly building it.

What's being tested in a fight?
The individual's aggression and raw physicality or the overall health of the fighter's community and culture?
When a fighter wins a competition their corner, coaches and training partners, celebrate the fighter's victory almost as if it was their own.
Why would that be if the fighters victory wasn't somehow a positive reflection on their own actions and beliefs.


I love mixed-martial arts.
I love fighting.
Large men put into vulnerable positions.
What goes up must come down.
Age will ultimately defeat them.
Beautiful bravery in an octagon.
It's an important ritual.
A focal point which creates social pressures which produce healthy social units.
Who are people cheering for?
You can hear the cheers.
The roar of the crowd is the echo of mankind's moral compass.

Francis Ngannou and Rhonda Rhousey.
Huge hole in their skillset.
A void in their model for dealing with life's obstacles.
Their opponent is an obstacle generator.

Fairplay morality in rats who wrestle.
Larger rat pins smaller rat most of the time.
If smaller rat doesn't win ever it'll stop playing the game.
Resistence is futile to a much more powerful opponenet.

Defend yourself with minimum necessary force...
That's a wise fight.
Sophistication is having great power but only using what's necessary.

The ruleset is minimal so it allows for people to improvise.
New techniques are created.
Old techniques are deployed in new contexts.
It's a culture of innovation.
It's the tip of the combat iceberg.

Physical violence and threats of physical violence have become taboo in western culture in the 21st century.
Children are taught that the correct way to deal with bullying is to tell adult authority figures who will administer justice with prudence and wisdom.
That's the ideal, and like most ideals it doesn't work that way in practice.
