MUSCLE MEN video

Hi everybody.
Remember these...

Maybe you do maybe you don't.
In the late 80s and early 90s these little pink wrestlers were everywhere.
You'd go to your friends house and you'd find a couple of them lying around.
I had a couple.
You could buy them from gumball machines or they'd be a prize in a box of crunch sugary whatevers.
I remember I found one at the bottom of a container of powdered cocoa. It was my favorite one because it always had this faint chocolate smell. 
I did a little research and discovered that the original mini pink muscle men were merchandise based on a Japanese anime about pro wrestlers set in space called Kinnikuman. Here's a snippet of the show's intro from its first season.

Great music. That show looks like a lot of fun. Anyways I don't have my pink muscle men anymore and I'm a nostalgic man-child so I'm going to make myself some new ones. This video will show you how I sculpted these muscle men using Blender, which is the best free 3D modelling and animation software out there, and how I 3d printed them.

Alright so first thing's first.
Download Blender if you haven't already.
Let's open it up and take a look at the interface.
Blender has a ton of features and it looks intimidating, but don't worry, because you don't need to know much, to do what I'm about to show you.

A quick aside...
If you're like me and you use an apple laptop with the finger pad without an external mouse or keyboard make sure you go to User Preferences > Input > and click "Select With: Left" and "Emulate Numpad". Otherwise the keyboard shortcuts and mouse clicking techniques I'm about to show you won't work.

So what are we looking at? We have a cube on a grid and then a bunch of menus. Where do we start? Well the first thing you'll want to do is learn how to control the camera. You can zoom by putting the cursor in the cube zone and pinching, and you can rotate around using double finger swipes. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to adjust the camera. Pressing 1 will move to Front Perspective and 3 will move you to Right perspective Pressing 7 is Top Perspective and 9 is Bottom Perspective. They don't look that different because our cube is symmetrical, but you notice the line colors changing. Those are your axes. X is red, Y is green, and Z is blue. Now when you start sculpting you'll want to make sure that the character's positioned properly in relation to these axes, because it'll allow you to jump to these really useful camera positions. What about the other number keys? 4 spins the grid clockwise and 6 counterclockwise. If you think of the grid as a sheet of paper slicing your character in half that you're holding it'll make visualizing these camera rotations easier. Pressing 2 will rotate the grid away from you, and 8 will rotate it towards you. Now what about 5? What's that doing? That's changing the perspective from isometric to vanishing point perspective. What's the difference? Well the easiest way to think about it is isometric perspective is like a map view, and vanishing point perspective is the personal view. If you know video games isometric perspective is used in games like Paperboy, King of the Monsters, and Q-Bert to show terrain and vanishing point perspective, or VP perspective is used in first person shooters, racing games, and rails shooters, because those games have to simulate how the human eye takes in the world. Confused? Well just switch between the two perspectives and choose whichever looks best or makes it easiest to do what you're doing.

Alright now let's turn this cube into the shape of a muscle man. I'm going to change to Edit mode. Notice the orange dots and lines now. I'm going to switch to the front view, and press ctrl-r to use the ring cut tool. Move the mouse until you see a vertical magenta line then click twice. Now I have a line down the middle. I'm going to move the camera a bit so I can hold shift and click these vertices. Then I press x, and select delete vertices. Why did I do that? Because we're going to add a mirror modifier. Click the wrench and select Add Modifier > Mirror. What just happened? Well because we're going to be sculpting a symmetrical human figure we can just worry about sculpting one half of the character, and let the software copy our changes to the other side. So if we switch to front view press g for grab and then start moving this vertices around you can see the shape change on both sides.

Okay let's really get busy sculpting now. I want to start with the torso. Torsos are usually wider than they are deep. So I'm going to press three for side view and then spin a bit. Now I'm going to shift click these four vertices and then press g for grab. Now I just want to move this side of the box in I don't want to pull it apart, so I'm going to press y so I can just slide the vertices along the y axis. I'm going to do the same to the other side now. Now I need some more vertices to play with, so I'm going to use the ring cut tool to create them. Ctrl R, and then move the line where you want to make the cut and click. So I'm going to make three horizontal cuts like so and I'm going to make his waist by selecting these vertices and pulling them in a bit. Now I'm going to switch to the top view and make a couple of ring cuts. Now I'm going make a neck, and to do that I'm going to select these vertices and press e for extrude then z to limit movement up and down and there I have a neck. Now I'm going to use the extrude tool again to make the head.
So just using just camera movements, cuts, extrudes, and axis limited grabs you can begin to define the overall shape of the figure very easily. One quick tip. If you want to clear selected vertices you can press a, a for all, to select everything and then a again to deselect everything. So I'll just quickly define the overall shape.

It's pretty generic looking, but that's okay, I'm going to save this and use it as a base for more detailed sculpts later.
Now the exciting part. Printing this thing! I want to make sure before I invest too much time into modelling that I can turn this gray box man into a plastic toy I can actually hold. I want a minimum viable product. If your dad comes barging into your room and asks you what you've been wasting your time on all night instead of homework it's better to show him an actual object rather than just the idea of one. And to the youngsters watching this just know that that will never change except it won't be your dad, it'll be your boss, unless you're the boss then it'll be your client. Get used to it. Okay enough crotchety old man talk.

I have to export my sculpture into a file format I can use with my 3d printer.
File > Export > STL

Now I'm going to open this up in my 3d printer's slicer software.
I use CURA.
So I'll open it
scale it up, and make a note to scale my base file later.

Now there's an art to getting your 3d printer configured, and getting the right settings for your particular setup. So I have a hictop cr-10 and I'm using PLA filament.

That's pretty exciting right? Like God you have formed man from nothing but your imagination, and a shit ton of technology made by people from all over planet Earth. Continue the creation my friends.

Thanks for watching.
