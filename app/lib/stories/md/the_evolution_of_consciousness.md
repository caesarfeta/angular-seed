Can we construct a being that can avoid the heat death of the universe?
dThe arrow of time, time itself, can be defined in terms of entropy...

I am not a scientist. I'm a visual artist and software developer with a proclivity for exploring Nature. I rely on my intuition a great deal when fixing bugs in software and generating ideas for drawings. I feel often that my mind is not totally under my control. I'm not a madman. I don't act on my impulses by I don't ignore them. My subconscious mind is a vast and deep ocean that my rational mind is floating on top. I listen to it like a kooky astronomer listens to static from stars hoping to make contact with an alien civilization. Except in my case I sometimes do.

Is consciousness an emergent property of networks?
Brains are neural networks.
Mycelium are networks created by fungi.
Both evolved as a means of combatting entropy.
Entropy, disorder of a closed system is increasing.
They are a means of coordinating the activity of a mass of cells to concentrate dispersed energy.
Self-aware organisms have to eat to live.
Life evolves as the universe expands.
Why don't we think of the universe as evolving?
Scientific nomenclature keeps us from synthesizing ideas.
What's in a name?
Apparently a lot.

Can consciousness only evolve within carbon based life forms?
Biological systems are the only place consciousness can exist according to popular belief.
Why do we think that?
