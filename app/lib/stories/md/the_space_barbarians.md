# The Space Barbarians

I was born in 1983.
It was peak space barbarian that year.
The 70s airbrushed vans, Frank Frazetta, Boris Vallejo.
The birth of Conan.
"Conan the Barbarian" came out in 1982.

The baby boomer generation entered the artistic sphere. Tales of individual bravery and cunning in battle in reaction to listening to the stories of their father's whose experience of war and tribal conflict was surviving becoming one of the millions of human offering to the industrial war machine.

Do you want to live forever?
Is it better to live a short heroic life as a sack of muscley desire or shall we enter the spirit realm where we live like dried leaves of 1s and 0s wafting through the breeze of universal consciousness or not at all... the verdict isn't out on that one yet.
What is more barbaric?
To give each fledgling human a chance to raise to the dominant spot of the life devouring pyramid.

Arnold Schwarzeneggar's career as a chiseled action robot was just beginning.
He was a bodybuilder and still very much mortal. This was an age where young men weren't exposed to the passions and horrors of humanity

Children across the world were playing with He-Man action figures.
Moebius and Heavy Metal magazine.
Heavy Metal as a musical genre had space barbarianism as it's visual correlation.


Muscles and laserbeams.
laserbeams and muscles.
How do muscles and laserbeams coexist?
We're soft gooey carbon base organisms who have to navigate a massive technology jungle gym that wants to use lasers and energy fields to disintegrate our mortal flesh.

When we leave this green, white, and blue marble for other planets who'll go there first?
The engineers? The pilots.
Pilots and engineers will get their first.
When will there be professional wrestlers in space?
What good is a generalized massive muscle machine against specialized steel and silicon?
Will the schemes of cloaked evil wizards commanding an army of machines with black magic defeat the pinnacle of individual might, physical mastery, and masculine bravery.
Let's hope not.

I'm not a serious person.
Actually I take that back I'm a very serious person who likes making jokes to relieve my anxiety... which I have a lot of.
This stress - humor relief bio-cycle has guided my life.
There's something inherently goofy about men in briefs fighting alien cyborgs.
It makes me laugh.
It's a way of relieving fears of traditional masculinity being consumbed by a tyranical high-tech hive.
How can we remain living like a lion pride when the evolution

Why did this happen?
What's our evolutionary options?
Will we become thin-limbed, massive headed, giant eyed, grey skinned aliens?
Or worse like Star Trek's the Borg, a hive-mind encased in a cube of wires with no bodies at all!
